# Dilo
Dilo looks up words at web dictionaries and shows the English/French/Spanish or German translation of that word. It is kind of comparable to “Babylon”® for Windows®, but uses a public web-dictionary instead of having a local one.

Dilo is basically concentrated on the German language, i.e. all translation are from/to German. Specifically, there is no translation e.g. between French and English or English and Spanish.

Dilo uses the Leo.org websites for the translation.

You can start up Dilo directly and enter something into the search field to search for or you can call it through the services menu “Define in Dilo”.

Also you can copy a text in another application and just start Dilo. Dilo will then automatically check for the text from the pasteboard if it is not called as a Service and if you have checked this feature in the preferences.

It doesn’t matter whether you are searching for an English/French/Spanish/Italian/Portuguese description of a German word or vice versa. Just select the word in the editor you are using, choose “Services->Define <Language> in Dilo” and that’s it.
